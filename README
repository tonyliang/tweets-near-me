===========================================================
Database : Mongodb
Collection : Capped, max:100000, 2d spatial index on location

Features:

0. Simple RSpec test on both model validation and controller.

1. EventMachine + Fiber was used to increase concurrency.
   The bottleneck is "query" action, which involves database access.
   For each connection, EventMachine will create a Fiber to access database.
   The CPU takes care for another connection and come back when EventMachine informs it the i/o is done. 

2. A rake task is contstantly running to fetch latest tweets from Twitter.
   Rake Task Name: fetch_tweet.rake

3. The main page has text fields for user to input Geo coordinates.
   User click search to center the Google map to appropriate location.
   In the meantime, an Ajax call is fired to "query" max 50 tweets (in the 
   circle certered from the geo coordinates appointed by user).

4. User click on picture on the map to see the detail of tweet.

5. User is able to drag the Google map to change current location and "query"
   new tweets with respect to current location.

6. The live demo is hosted on Heroku.
